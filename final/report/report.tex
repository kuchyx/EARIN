\section{Introduction}
The goal of our project was to create a model for anime reccomender \\ 
After entering anime name from the database model should output recommended animes 
\section{Used data and algorithms}
\subsection{Data}
We used different dataset from originally specified in the project description \\ 
We decided to use Anime Recommendation Database from Kaggle: \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020}{LINK} \\ 
Main reasons why we decided to use this database was that it was bigger than original one, was more recent, it was described as being 100\% usable by Kaggle and still had decent amount of code examples \\ 
We are mostly interested in rating\_complete.csv file which contains information about anime ratings from users who completed the anime 
\subsection{Algorithms}
We decided to use collaborative filtering to develop our model, It makes personalized recommandations based on preferences of similar users \\ 
We represent anime data-set as embedding vector \\ 
We use K-nearest neighbors model and decided to test it out with different metrics, neighbors and algorithms \\ 
\subsubsection{Algorithms}
We decided to test our model with 3 algorithms:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ball Tree
  \item KD Tree 
  \item Brute
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Neighbor number}
We decided to test our model with 5 different neighbor amount:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 5
  \item square root of available data
  \item half of available data
  \item logarithm of available data
  \item n-1 neighbors 
\end{enumerate}
